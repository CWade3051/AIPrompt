        "instructions": "To show all apps installed on your macOS system, you can use the `ls` command with specific flags.\n\nCommand:\n`ls -l /Applications`\n\nThis will list all applications installed in the `/Applications` directory. Note that some apps may be hidden or require additional permissions to view. If you're looking for a specific app, you might need to know its name or developer to filter the results.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- You must have read access to the `/Applications` directory.\n- Ensure you're logged in with admin privileges if some apps are restricted.\n\nExpected output:\nYou should see a list of application files and directories, possibly followed by other system files or hidden files in that directory. Each entry will start with a user and group ID, followed by the file size, permissions, ownership, and the filename.\n\nError handling:\n- If you encounter a `Permission denied` error, it means you don't have read access to `/Applications`. You may need to use `sudo` or check your permissions.\n- The output might be extensive; you can pipe it to `less` for easier navigation: `\nl\u0441 -l /Applications | less`\n\nAlternative approaches:\n1. Use the **Grapher** app (built-in macOS utility) for a more user-friendly interface.\n2. Open Terminal and use `open -a Terminal .` if you're in a specific folder to access it there.\n3. Use `brew` (Homebrew) if you've installed any third-party applications that don't show up in the standard list.",

The system cannot find the `ls` binary in the specified path.\n2. The path `/usr/bin` does not exist on your system.\n3. The binary has been removed or is not installed.\n\nTo fix this, you can try one of these solutions:\n1. Reinstall the operating system to restore the missing binary (not recommended for production systems).\n2. Use `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ls` if you're using Ubuntu/Debian to install `ls` again.\n3. Check if `/usr/bin` exists by running `ls -l /usr/bin` or try another path like `/bin/ls` which is commonly available.\n4. If you have a backup or installed the system from a custom source, use that source to find and restore the binary.",

If it still doesn't work, it might be best to reinstall your system or check if `ls` is available in another location.",
