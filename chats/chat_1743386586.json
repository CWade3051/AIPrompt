Running this command will display all mounted filesystems along with their sizes and free space. You can pipe the output to another command like `column -t` to align the columns neatly. If you want to include only specific directories or partitions, adjust the arguments accordingly. For example, to show disk usage on the root directory and macOS partition, you can use `df -k /; df -k /Volumes`. This will give you a clear view of both system disks and external volumes.",
