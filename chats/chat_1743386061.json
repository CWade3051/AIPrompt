        "instructions": "To show all disks and their free space in a nice table format:\n1. **Command**: `lsblk` is used to list block devices and their partitions.\n2. **Options**:\n- `-o` specifies the output columns to display, including NAME (device name), MOUNTPOINT (where it's mounted), SIZE (size of the partition), RoW (read-only status), and RO (removable media status).\n3. **Explanation**: The `lsblk` command will list all disk devices and partitions in a clear format. Each device will show its name, mount point, size, read-only status, and whether it's removable.\n4. **Expected Output**: You should see a table-like output with columns for DEVICE, MOUNTPOINT, SIZE, RoW, RO. For example:\n\n`NAME   MOUNTPOINT       SIZE  RoW  RO\"\n`[some device]   [mount point]    [size]\n...etc.\n5. **Notes**: If you're on a system where `lsblk` isn't installed or isn't available, you can use `fdisk -l` instead.\n6. **Alternative Approach**: Alternatively, use `df` to show disk space usage but it might not provide the same level of detail about device types and mount points.",
