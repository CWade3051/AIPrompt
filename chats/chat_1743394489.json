For example:\n\nFilesystem     Size  Used Available Use% | Mounted on\n-----------------------------------------\n/dev/sda1        50G   40G    10G  80% /boot\n/dev/sda2       500G 300G  200G  60% /home\n...\n\nIf the output is too long or you want more details, you can add options like '-h' for human-readable numbers.\n",
