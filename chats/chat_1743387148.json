        "instructions": "To show disk usage, `df` is a utility that displays the amount of free space left on each filesystem. Here's how it works:\n\n- **Command**: df -h\n- **What it does**: Shows the disk space in a human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB) for all mounted filesystems.\n- **Example Output**:\n  Filesystem Size   Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n  /dev/sda1      50G   20G   30G 40% /\n  /dev/sdb1      100G   80G   20G 80% /home\n  tmpfs           3.9G     0G    3.9G   0% /tmp\n- **Prerequisites**: You should be logged in as a user with appropriate permissions to view disk space.\n- **Security Note**: Ensure you don't execute this command without the necessary permissions to avoid potential security risks.",
