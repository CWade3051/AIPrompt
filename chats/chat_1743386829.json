It accesses the URL pointing to the user's gists, which returns a JSON response containing information about each gist.\n\nThe output will be in JSON format, listing details like the gist's ID, content type (e.g., JavaScript, HTML), and the filename of the gist.\n\nIf you want to view specific files or extract more detailed information, you can parse this JSON data further using tools like `jq` or `python`.",
