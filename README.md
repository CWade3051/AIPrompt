### Building from Source

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- GitHub Personal Access Token (for release management)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIPrompt.git
cd AIPrompt

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Build and Release Process

The project uses a cross-platform build pipeline that handles version management and releases:

1. **Creating a New Release**
   ```bash
   # Set your GitHub token
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token  # On macOS/Linux
   $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token"  # On Windows

   # Create a new release (increment version and build)
   python version.py [major|minor|patch] "Your release description"
   ```
   This will:
   - Increment the version number
   - Update the changelog
   - Build for the current platform
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload the current platform's build

2. **Building for Other Platforms**
   After creating a release on one platform, build for the other platform:
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   .\build-win.ps1
   # On macOS:
   ./build-mac.sh
   ```
   The build script will:
   - Build the application
   - Automatically update the latest GitHub release with the new platform build

3. **Manual Building (without release)**
   To build without creating a release:
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   .\build-win.ps1
   # On macOS:
   ./build-mac.sh
   ```
   Builds will be available in the `release` directory.

#### Build Output Locations
- Windows: `release/AIPrompt-win.exe`
- macOS: `release/AIPrompt-mac.zip`
